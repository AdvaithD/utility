# utility
A repo containing all the files/configs I frequently use.

Currently contains the following:
---------------------------------
- TypedJS
- Animate.css
- Bootstrap4 starter HTML and files
- A simple gulpfile that utilizes BrowserSync to facilitate livereloads for HTML dev.(I'm learning a lot of HTML designing right now, so this proves to be extremely helpful)
